Gameboy Emulator
-------

This is my first attempt at writing an emulator.

###Resources:

- [Gameboy CPU instruction set](http://www.pastraiser.com/cpu/gameboy/gameboy_opcodes.html)
- [Gameboy CPU manual](docs/GBCPUman.pdf)
- [EMULib](http://fms.komkon.org/EMUL8/EMULib.html) by Marat Fayzullin
- [irrlicht](http://irrlicht.sourceforge.net/) for rendering
- [GBDev on nesdev.com](http://forums.nesdev.com/viewforum.php?f=20) so much help from here!
- [blargg test roms](http://gbdev.gg8.se/files/roms/blargg-gb-tests/) source/roms also included in this repo

Main development is done on OSX 10.9 in xcode. I am going to try to maintain the makefile as much as possible. I'm using irrlicht for rendering in the hopes that I can keep the build cross platform.
